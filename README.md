# OctoPrint-EXOTouch 0.1.0


# Basado en OctoPrint-EXOTouch 0.3.5
This plugin will transform the OctoPrint layout into a Mobile/TFT friendly layout. With larger buttons and a responsive layout down to the smallest resolution possible. It will mimic pointer events as touch, so you can hook up those touchscreens. It also supports a virtual keyboard.

All these settings are set client-side, so we won't interfere with other clients. All settings are stored in your localstorage or as a delicious cookie. You can find the `EXOTouch settings` in a dedicated modal. Remember they're stored on your device, so if you login with your desktop computer you won't get the touch interface.
